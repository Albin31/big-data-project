# big-data-project
Project supervised by Boris Teabe and Daniel Hagimont. It consists in creating a cluster of 4 virtual machines with spark ML deployed on this cluster. It contains also an interface made with python. This project doesn't holds the files to install and configurate jdk, hadoop and spark (too heavy).
